# Push Notifications in React with OneSigna

Itâ€™s no secret that push notifications can help you engage and retain app users. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to integrate with the React-OneSignal NPM package to leverage push notifications in your React app.

## Install OneSignal NPM package
Inside of your project folder, open your terminal and run the following command to install the React OneSignal NPM package.
```shell
npm i react-onesignal
```
After you have successfully installed the npm package, open your App.js file, you will enter the following line of code at the top of the file:
```javascript
import OneSignal from 'react-onesignal';
```

The code above will make the OneSignal object accessible and will allow you to have access to the OneSignal SDK properties.
In the same file, we will create a `useEffect` hook. This hook will have the initialization code needed to trigger OneSignal. Remember to add the dependency array `[]`  to your `useEffect` hook. The init() method from OneSignal can only be called once and the dependency array will help us to avoid that the `useEffect` gets triggered multiple times firing the `init()` method.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
   OneSignal.init({
     appId: "YOUR-APP-ID-HERE"
   });
 }, []);
```
